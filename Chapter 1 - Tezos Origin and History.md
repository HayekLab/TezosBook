If anyone look at the history and the evolution of cryptography, it will look like a hockey stick. Prior to the 20th century, cipher method were crude with 1 to 1 fixed substitution of letters Atbash or Caesar cipher. Then it became more elaborate with a substitution that would be changing based on a key or password, with such keys getting and substitution algorithm becoming more sophisticated. But a big leap occurred with the introduction of asymmetric key algorithm in 1976 that finally allowed two parties to be able to communicate securely without having to use the same exact key. The first such algorithm was the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and was quickly followed by RSA for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, the 3 inventors, which is based on prime numbers. The secret key is essentially composed of two very such large prime numbers and the public key is their factoring product. RSA relies on the fact it is extremely difficult to derive the original very large prime numbers when you start with their product. This open the door to the ability of electronically signing documents and revolutionized the industry with many other possible use. Later came more elaborate asymmetric encryption algorithm such elliptic curve cryptography.

I personally have an interesting story to share about RSA. I had an interview for a job at a company a few years ago, and I was mentioning in passing that the asymmetric encryption algorithm used by Bitcoin is elliptic curve cryptography. He argued me with that it is RSA because that’s what is asymmetric encryption. I told him, yes RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm but that is not the one used by Bitcoin. Although he didn’t know anything about Bitcoin, he kept arguing because to him, there is only one thing that exist and it is RSA. At least he was aware RSA uses large prime numbers, and clearly he didn’t know anything about ECC but rather than asking me about it, he didn’t want to admit this. ECC was developed in 1985 and only became widely used in the mid 1990s. Yes, the guy was in his late 50s and probably only remember using RSA in his college years.

At the same time as these huge development in cryptography was happening, the Internet was slowly growing from being used only by academics and institutions to eventually the nerds and then the early adopters and finally the grandmas on Facebook and Amazon. Cryptography allowed these payments online to be made so cryptography and the Internet was a revolutionary combo. However, all interaction happens to rely on a single central authority to manage it. This is particularly true when it comes to money, well what used to be called money, but now should only be called paper currency with its very value so ephemeral that it essentially has to be backed by people with guns.
