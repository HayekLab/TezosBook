# TezosBook
An introductory book about Tezos, the crypto-currency with delegated proof of stake, smart contracts and governance.

Content also available on google drive

The content of this book will come from the contributions of many writers in the Tezos community.

This book will be licensed under [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0](./LICENSE)

Hayek Lab (HayekLab.com) will create a PDF version of the book to be distributed for free. Considering
a paper book has better appeal to some readers and will give more prominence to Tezos, Hayek Lab intends on paying for
the formatting required in order to publish the book in a physical paper book in softcover format. The book will be sold
without any goals of making a profit but rather to mainly cover costs. Hayek Lab's role in this is to serve as
the core editor and become the publisher and main collaborator in this project with the main intention to educate the growing Tezos
community, whether they are investors, bakers, educators or smart contract developers.

Among the contributors of this project, we hope to see Graphic Designers as well as developers, editors, writers and 
proof-writers. Of course, we hope the Tezos foundation and the developers of the Tezos source code will help in 
validating and perhaps even contribute to documentation for this book.

Contributors can start at any time, some of the team members at Hayek Lab will do so as well. To participate, we will begin by
using the GitHub.com platform where contributors can make comments or open pull requests with changes. We may choose
to use google drive as well. Start by looking at the [Notes and references](Notes%20and%20References.md) document. Note 
that the book will also list the name of all contributors - unless of course they want to stay anonymous, or to use a 
pseudonym. We may choose google drive as well.

In addition, we would like the community of writers to be rewarded for their contribution to the book (in tezzies 
of course). The community will choose through voting on how the tezzies should be distributed among the 
contributors. A Tezos address has been setup for this purpose and Hayek Lab has funded it with an initial 200 tezzies:

Note that Phil Champagne and any other member of Hayek Lab is excluded from this reward.

Anyone can contribute donation as well.

We will use our twitter account ([@HayekLab][hayek-lab-twitter]) to broadcast announcements related to this project.
