This file is meant to contain notes about what content should be included, in what order, and presented in what specific way.

The current table of content is listed as this:

Chapter 1 - Tezos Origin And History
The chapter proposed title is "Tezos Origin and history". A good piece of inspiration for this chapter can come from 
the Wired Magazine article, but there are a lot of other information to cover. The lawsuits against the Foundation
would also be covered, our personal view is this move was likely premeditated before the ICO.

Chapter 2 - A General Overview of Tezos
This chapter will provide the 30,000 foot level covering Functional Programming and formal verification, Delegated proof 
of stake, governance and smart contracts. 
This should cover delegated proof of stake which has recently be nicknamed Liquid Proof Of Stake when comparing with other
crypto-currency's proof of stake. Good articles for inspiration:
