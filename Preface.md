A person investigating Tezos via a google search will quickly find out about lawsuits, Foundation controversy and internal battles and a mention of an important delay on the release of the software. This has been the stigma that Tezos was associated before during and after the release of the Betanet version on July 1st 2018. So what about the launch itself? It is only after some more digging that one will realize the betanet has been so far flawless with only a few software updates to address minor issues. Nothing compared to drama that occured with EOS or other launches. 

So all the negativity associated with this cryptocurrency are off the blockchain and its software. Considering this is a decentralized crypto-currency, how can a lawsuit against its founders and the Tezos Foundation could pose any risk to it? The short answer: no downside risk, just the risk of minimizing its upside potential considering the foundation has several hundred of millions in US dollars to work with to fund many projects that will improve Tezos infrastructure and general ecosystem.
